Question6:-

Answer:-

meaningful and discriptive variable names make our code more readable and understandable. When someone, including ourself, reads the code later on, descriptive variable names make it easier to comprehend the purpose and intent of the variable. It reduces confusion and helps in quickly grasping the logic and flow of the program.

For Example:-

// Unclear and less readable variable names
let x = 10;
let y = 5;

let result = x + y;

// Clear and readable variable names
let width = 10;
let height = 5;

let area = width + height;
