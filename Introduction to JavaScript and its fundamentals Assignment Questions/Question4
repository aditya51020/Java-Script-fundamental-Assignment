Question4:-

Answer:-

We can declare variables to store goodies, visitors, and other data. 
To create a variable in JavaScript, use the let keyword. To be concise, we can combine the variable declaration and assignment into a single line:



 let message = 'Hello!'

The statement below creates (in other words: declares) a variable with the name “message”:

 let message;

Now, we can put some data into it by using the assignment operator =:
 
 let message;

 message = 'Hello';

The string is now saved into the memory area associated with the variable. We can access it using the variable name:
 
 let message;
 message = 'Hello!';

 alert(message);
