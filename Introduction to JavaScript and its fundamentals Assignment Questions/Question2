Question2:-

Answer:-

HTML defines the content and structure of a web page, while JavaScript allows for manipulation of the content and the behavior of the page

HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is a markup language used for creating static web pages, while JavaScript is a programming language used for creating interactive and dynamic web pages.

HTML is declarative and does not have the ability to perform logic or make decisions, while javaScript is a scripting language and can perform logic, make decisions, and manipulate the HTML DOM.

for example:-

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>JavaScript Example</title>
    <script>
        function greetUser() {
            var userName = prompt("What's your name?");
            alert("Hello, " + userName + "!");
        }
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>Welcome to My Webpage</h1>
    <button onclick="greetUser()">Say Hello</button>
</body>

</html>
